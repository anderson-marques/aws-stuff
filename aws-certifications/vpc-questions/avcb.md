# Additional VPC CIDR blocks

You have created a VPC with CIDR 10.0.0.0/24. The VPC has two subnets: public (10.0.0.0/25) and private (10.0.0.128/25). For an anticipated project you want to increase the CIDR range your VPC CIDR block, How can you do this?

1. Change the subnet sizes to /28 subnets, then you will have more room to grow your VPC CIDR
2. You can always change a VPC's original CIDR block as needed
3. You can add additional VPC CIDR blocks, but canâ€™t change the existing one
4. Delete all the subnets first, only then you can modify the size of the VPC

Choices Analysis:
1. **Incorrect** - VPC CIDR block can not be changed. 
2. **Incorrect** - VPC CIDR block can not be changed. 
3. **Correct** - You can add additional VPC CIDR blocks, but can't change the existing one
4. **Incorrect** - You still can't change the VPC CIDR
