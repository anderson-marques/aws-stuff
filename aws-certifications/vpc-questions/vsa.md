# VPN SSH Access

Using the VPC wizard, you have created a VPC with CIDR 10.0.0.0/16 with a VPN-only private subnet and Hardware VPN Access connection. You need to connect to an instance in the private subnet over SSH.

How should you define the instanceâ€™s security group rule to allow SSH?

1. **Allow Inbound traffic for SSH (port 22) from the corporate network**
2. Allow port 22 on the security group of the VPN-only subnet to allow SSH inbound
3. Create a public subnet, Implement a NAT instance and use it to connect to the VPN-only subnet instances
4. Allow Inbound traffic on port 22 to allow you to connect to a private subnet over the Internet

Choices Analysis:
1. **Correct** - From the corporate network, connect to the private subnet over port 22
2. **Incorrect** - There is no such a thing as security group of a VPN subnet
3. **Incorrect** - NAT instances are not for Internet Initiated connections
4. **Incorrect** - The VPC has not been configured with a public subnet for Internet Access
