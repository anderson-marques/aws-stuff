# Deleting an IGW attached to a VPC

You are helping a junior engineer understand why she is **not able to delete the IGW** that was configured and used for the test VPC in your AWS test environment.

Which of the below would help her understand this better?

1. IGW can not be deleted without deleting the VPC and all its resources
2. IGW is serving Internet traffic, the user has to wait until traffic ceases before deletion
3. You can not delete an IGW after is has been created
4. **The IGW is attached to the VPC and it has to be detached first before attempting the deletion**.

_Choices Analysis_:
1. **Incorrect** - Deleting the IGW is not conditional upon deleting the VPC
2. **Incorrect** - AWS is concerned with dependence between services, not if the IGW has traffic flowing through it
3. **Incorrect** - You can delete an IGW if you satisfy AWS's requirements before deletion
4. **Correct**

**Remember**:

- You can not delete an IGW that is attached to a VPC
    - You have to detach the IGW from the VPC first, then you can delete it
- Likewise, you cannot delete a VPC that has an IGW attached to it, 
    - You have to detach the IGW first, the you can delete the VPC (if it had no EC2 instances connected to it)
