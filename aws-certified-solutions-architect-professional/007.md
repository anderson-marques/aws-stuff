# Self Healing Capabilities

In information technology, self-healing describes about any device or system that has ability to perceive that is not operating correctly and, without human intervention, makes the necessary steps to restore itself to normal operation.

To buil self-healing application, we need to use combination of many AWS tools, including:

- AWS Auto Scaling Groups
- Elastic Load Balancer
- Cloud Watch
- Route53
- RDS with Multi-AZ

## Multi-AZ Architectures

Multi-AZ services can help us mitigate the loss of any availability zone or even two AZ (if we assume there are more than two AZ in the region).

This provides good balance when it comes to cost, complexity and reliability.
