# High Availability

**High Availability** is a characterist of the system design which makes resource available even in the case of any component failure in a computer system.

Availability refers to ammount of time that the system is in functioning condition

General Availability: 100% minus system downtime

| Percent of uptime| Max Downtime per yer |Equiv downtime per day
|---|---|---|
|90%|36.5 days|2.4 hours|
|99%|3.65 days|14 minutes|
|99.9%|8.76 hours|86 seconds|

- AWS EC2 SLA is 99.95% which means ~22 minutes per month.

## Probability

Events that might disrupt the system's availability can occurs any time, we need to make sure that application is designed to be highly available.

## Important Points

Improving availability leads to increase in cost. Thus it's important to balance between the cost factor and the availability.

SLA of your organization matter. 90% SLA means 2.4 hour of downtime every day.
