# RTO & RPO

## Everything comes at price

High availiability architerture is driven by your requirements.

An high available, multi-AZ, fault tolerant infrastructure is certainly possible, however there is a cost associated with it.

## Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the amount of time frame it takes for you to recover your infrastructure and business operations after disaster has struck.

Sample example:

    If RTO is 3 hours, then you needs to invest quiet good amount of money to make sure a secondary regions is always ready in-case main region goes down due to disaster.

## Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is concerned with data and maximum tolerance period to which data can be lost.

It helps in determining how well we should be designing the infrastructure.

Sample example:

    If RPO is 5 hours for database, then we should be taking backup of database every five hours.

## RTO vs RPO

RTO is more broader scope and covers whole business and systems involved while RPO is more directly related to interval of backup to take to avoid data loss.

- RP question: How far back from disaster? (Lost data)
- RT question: How long to recover from disaster? (restoration)
