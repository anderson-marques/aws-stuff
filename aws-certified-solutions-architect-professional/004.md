# Multi-Region with Route53

## Route53 for Disaster Recovery

Route53 is one of the great service that will help us achieve the active-passive based failover which the multi-site based disaster recovery model is about.

Using Health checks in conjunction with Hosted zones and Traffic Policies we can configure to send traffic to another region in case of disaster.
