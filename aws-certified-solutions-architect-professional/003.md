# Disaster Recovery Techniques

## How to design

There can be various disaster recovery design that we can implement, this directly depends on thow quickly we want to recover from a disaster, in short RTO (Return Time Objective) and RPO (Return Point Objective).

Broadly classified into 4 types:

1. Backup & Restore
2. Pilot Light
3. Warm Standby
4. Multi-Site

### Backup and Restore

Based on simple / cost effective method which requires us to constantly take backup of our data and store it to service like S3 and restore when disaster strikes.

For on-premise server with huge amount of data typically in tens of terabytes, then can use technology like **direct connect or import/export** to backup their data to AWS.

### Pilot Light

Minimal version of server in stopped state or in form of an AMI. It kind of a redundacy where there are a active version of your system and a passive version of your system that takes control only in case of disaster.

_**Before the Disaster**_:

| Resource | Active Infrastructure | Pilot Light Infrastructure|
|--- | --- | --- |
| Web Server | Running | Not Running |
| App Server | Running | Not Running |
| Database | Serving | Mirroning |
| |  |  |

_**After the Disaster**_:

| Resource | Active Infrastructure | Pilot Light Infrastructure|
|--- | --- | --- |
| Web Server | Stopped | Running |
| App Server | Stopped | Running |
| Database | Stopped | Serving |
| |  |  |

### Warm Standby

Server runs with minimal sizes.
When disaster happens, the server are scaled up for production.

_**Before the Disaster**_:

| Resource | Main Infrastructure | Warm Infrastructure|
|--- | --- | --- |
| Web Server | Running | Running Small instance |
| App Server | Running | Running Small instance|
| Database | Serving | Mirroning |
| |  |  |

_**After the Disaster**_:

| Resource | Main Infrastructure | Warm Infrastructure|
|--- | --- | --- |
| Web Server | Stopped | Running instances scales up and out|
| App Server | Stopped | Running instances scales up and out|
| Database | Stopped | Serving |
| |  |  |

### Multi-Site

Complete 1 to 1 mirror of your production environment.

_**Before the Disaster**_:

| Resource | Site A | Site B|
|--- | --- | --- |
| Web Server | Running | Running |
| App Server | Running | Running |
| Database | Serving/mirroring | Serving/mirroring |
| |  |  |

_**After the Disaster**_:

| Resource | Site A | Site B|
|--- | --- | --- |
| Web Server | Stopped | Running |
| App Server | Stopped | Running |
| Database | Stopped | Serving |
| |  |  |
