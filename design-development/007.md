# API Gateway

It is a routing layer that allows you to configure many rules on the same domain and connect it to many different resources.

For instance:

| Origin | Routing Layer | Service Target |
|--- | --- | --- |
| Internet | API Gateway |  Elastic Load Balancer |
| - | - |  Elastic Beanstalk |
| - | - |  Lambda Function |
| - | - | Kinesis Stream |

API Gateway important concepts

- Resource - API Gateway resource target
- Method - Action or Objective
- Integration Request - Manipules the request before deliver to AWS Resource
- Integration Response - Manipules the response before deliver to the Requester

API Gateway Stages

Enable the option to create from mock to production environments:

Best practices:

- `sandbox` - Return pre defined responses based on the requests
- `development` - Points to development resources
- `staging` - Points to staging resources (master branch) prepared to releasing
- `production` - Points to production environment resources
