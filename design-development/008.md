# Messaging Services

- **Simple Queue Services - SQS** - Messaging queue based system
  - Clients sends messages to the queue
  - Consumers polling for messages on the queue
  - Delay Seconds
    - Amount of time to delay the visibility of an incoming message
  - Visibility Timeout
    - Amount of time to make the message invisible after it has been read by a consumer
  - The consumer should delete the message use they've finished processing the message.
  - Default delay seconds and visibility timeout are set on the queue, but a consumer can override them

- Kinesis Streams - Real-time stream-bsed messaging service
  - Sometimes SQS isn't good enough for your application use cases
  - You could want to avoid the polling process and use a more real-time solution
  - Real-time data streaming
  - Scales quickly and easily
  - Allows multiple producers and consumers
  - Kinesis Stream Shards
    - Basic unit of Stream capacity. One shard equals 1 MB / second of input and 2 MB / second of output
