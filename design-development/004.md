# EC2 REST API

- Each AWS REST API request must be signed

Steps to Authenticate:

1. Create a request
2. Create an `HMAC-SHA1` using the `Secret Access Key`
3. Send the request and signature to AWS
4. Retrieve the `Secret Access Key`
5. Generates a new Signature
6. Compare the two Signatures

Using the SDK means never having to manually sign a request
