# History of Kinesis

## Where Kinesis came from

Before stremming processing age, there was the batch processing age.

- Producers generates data
- Data is aggregated in storage like S3/HDFS
- Consumer process the aggregated data what took hours or even days if huge big data

## Why do we need new tool

Today, some data has more value or is only valuable for a short time. Example:

- Stock market
- Clickstream analysis
- Fraud detection

Other use case is when there are a relation of many to many between producers and consumers. For instance, the last contracted loan operation can be in interest of security, marketing, investiment and auditing.
