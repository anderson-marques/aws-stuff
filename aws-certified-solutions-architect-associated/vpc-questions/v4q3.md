# VPC subnets Characteristics

Which of the following are characteristics of Amazon VPC subnets? (Choose 2)

1. **Each subnet maps to a single Availability Zone**
2. A CIDR block mask of /25 is the smallest range supported
3. Instances in a private subnet can communicate with the Internet only if they have an Elastic IP
4. **By default, all subnets in a VPC can route to one another without additional configuration**
5. Each subnet spans at least 2 Availability zones to provide a high-availability environment 

1. 4 and 5
2. 1 and 3
3. 1 and 4
4. **1 and 4**
5. 3 and 4

_Analysis_:

2. /28 is the smallest
3. They can do so via a NAT instance/gateway

**Remember**:

- A VPC subnet is confined to on AZ
- A VPC subnet CIDR can be /28 minimum and up to /16 maximum
    - You can not configure smaller than /28 CIDR
    - You can not configure larger than /16 CIDR
- A VPC subnet can be private subnet that can access internet via a NAT instance/gateway
    - Or a VPN only subnet that only can be access through your Data Center
- A VPC subnet can also be a public subnet where each instance deployed within must have either a public or Elastic IP address, must have its route table pointing to a VPC IGW for 0.0.0.0/0 destinations (default route), and the VPC must have an IGW attached to it
