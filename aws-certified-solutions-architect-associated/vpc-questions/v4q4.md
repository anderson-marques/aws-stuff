# VPC subnets Design

You have been assigned a task to design a VPC for a web-application consisting of an **internet-facing Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**, a fleet of web/application servers, and an **RDS database**. The entire Infrastructure must be highly available using two **Availability zones**. The **database should not be accessible** from the Internet.

Which of the below configurations would work?

1. One public subnet for the web-servers, One public subnet for ELB ,and one private subnet for the database
2. Two private subnets for the web-servers, One public subnet for ELB, Two private subnets for database
3. **Two private subnets for the web-servers, Two public subnets for ELB, and two private subnets for database**
4. Two public subnets for the web-servers, Two public subnets for ELB, and two public subnets for database

_Analysis_:
1. **Incorrect** - One subnet for each can NOT be the basis of multi AZ
2. **Incorrect** - For the ELB to load balance in two AZs, it must have one public subnet in each AZ
3. **Correct**
4. **Incorrect* - DB subnets are requested to be private, and not accessible from the internet
