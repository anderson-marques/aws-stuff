# Launching EC2 instances in a VPC

How can you predefine which private IPv4 addresses would be assigned to your EC2 instances ENI interfaces?

1. Assign a group or sequential Elastic IP address to the instances
2. Launch the instances in a Placement Group
3. **Launch the instances in Amazon virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**
4. Launch the Instance from a private Amazon Machine image (AMI)

_Choices Analysis_:
1. **Incorrect** - Elastic IP address are limited, and you can not control it sequencing
2. **Incorrect** - Placement groups are for lower latency, higher performance in an AZ
3. **Correct** - VPC provides you the control over the IP addressing to use/assign to the instances
4. **Incorrect** - This has nothing to do with assigning IP addresses to the instance

**Quick refresher**: 
- When launching an EC2 instance in a VPC you can
    - Leave it to AWS to select the best AZ for your EC2 instance
    - Or, specify which AZ you want your EC2 instance launched in
    - Also, you can leave it to AWS to assign an IP address for your instance
    - Or, you can assign the IP address (if you chose the subnet for the EC2 instance) in the subnet where you want to launch your EC2 instance
