# Enhanced Networking

How a customer can achieve highest packets per second performance, combined with low latency and lowest jitter, in an EC2 cluster. The cluster wil be hosted in an AWS VPC accross multiple availaility zones for high availability.

What is the recommendation to achieve this?

1. Use Placement Groups, one in each AZ and join them together
2. Use GRE tunnels accorss the availability zones and configure quality of service
3. **Use Enhanced Networking over HVM virtualized instances**
4. You can't provide high PPS in AWS across multiple availability zones
