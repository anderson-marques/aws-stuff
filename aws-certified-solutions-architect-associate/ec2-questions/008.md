# EC2 Troubleshooting

An EC2 instance cannot connect to the Internet. The instance is launched in a public subnet, the VPC has an Internet Gateway attached, and the public subnet's route table, security groups and NACL's are all configured properly.

What else could be the cause of this issue?

1. The instance may not have an ENI created
2. The instance could be parte of a placement group
3. **The instance does not have a public or Elastic IP address assigned/attached**
4. The instance might not be going through a NAT gateway
