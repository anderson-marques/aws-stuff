# Instance Purchase Options

Your application is primarily dependent on Reserved and On-demand instances to handle the normal traffic. the application is designed such that a job queue is available, and **a failed job at one instance is returned to the queue to be handled by another instance**. You have a temporary higher number of jobs that you would like to **quickly, and cost effective**, process by adding additional instances. The additional instances will only be required for a short period of time until this job load is processed.

Which EC2 instances option would you use to achieve this?

1. Use Reserved Instances, they guarantee capacity
2. Use on-demand instances because this is just a short period of time
3. Spot instances
4. Do not add new instances, the existing can handle the load over time
