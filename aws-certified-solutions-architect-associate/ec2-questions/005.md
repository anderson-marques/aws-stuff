# Instance Purchase Options

Your application is primarily dependent on **Reserved and On-demand instances to handle the normal traffic**. The application is designed such that a job queue is available, and **a failed job at one instance is returned to the queue to be handled by another instance.** You have a temporary higher number of jobs that you would like to **cost effectively** process by adding additional instances. The additional instances will only be required for a **short period of time** until this job load is processed.

Which EC2 instance option should you use to achieve this?

1. Use Reserved Instances, they guarantee capacity
2. Use on-demand instances because this is just a short period of time
3. **Spot instances**
4. Do no add new instances, the existing can handle the load over time

Choice Analysis:

1. **Incorrect** - The need is only for a short period of time. RIs have 1 year or 3 year commitment
2. **Incorrect** - On-demand instance are more expensive than Spot and RIs
3. **Correct** - Since the application can tolerate instance termination/failures
4. **Incorrect** - It is a requirement to clear the higher jobs faster
