# Bootstraping

Each time an  instance is launched, a long time is spent configuring the instance and updating OS before it can be ready for the intended use. How can you speed up this process and shorten the time it takes for the instance to be ready for use? (Choose 2)

1. Use another scripting language to speed up manual stuff after the instance is launched
2. **Use the `user data` field when launching an instance to bootstrap the EC2 instance which is faster than manually updating the instance after it is launched**
3. **Create an AMI from a ready instance, and use this AMI to launch new instances**
4. There is no way you can automate or shorten the time it takes to make an EC2 instance ready after launch
