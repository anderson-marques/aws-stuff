What EC2 instance attribute would allow you to pass a script to instruct the instance to communicate with a certificate server and pass its instance ID once launched?

1. AMI roles
2. EC2 tags
3. This needs to be done manually or through an application after the instance is launched
4. **You can use the `user data` field to pass on the required script**
