# EC2 - Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-I/OV)

Is a network interface (host interface) virtualization whereby, a guest machine (EC2 instance) has direct access to a virtual network interface without hypervisor being in the middle (emulating a vNIC).

- SR-I/OV
  - Not supported on all instances types
  - SR-I/OV is supported on R4, X1, P2, C3/4, R3, I2, M4, D2
- For supported instance types, SR-I/OV provides:
  - Higher packet per second (PPS) performance for data transfers
  - Lower latency
  - Very low network Jitter
