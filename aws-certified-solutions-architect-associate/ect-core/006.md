# EC2 Instance Families

Choice of CPU, memory, storage, network, hardware, acceleration for your needs. Determines the hardware of the host computed used.

- General Purpose (T, M)
  - Balanced memory and CPU
  - Suitable for most applications
  - T2 instances:
    - Lowest cost general purpose instance type - Balance of compute, memory and network resources
    - T2.micro eligible for free tier
    - Baseline CPU performance with ability to burst
    - Burst is governated by CPU credits - Aquire CPU credits when idle and use it when needed
    - Good choice for workloads that doesn't use full CPU but burst occasionally
    - Suitable for webserver, development environments and databases
  - M4 instances:
    - Latest generation and provides a balance of compute, memory, network resources
    - Good choice for many applications
    - EBS optmized at no additional cost
    - Support for enhanced networking
  - M3 Instances:
    - SSD Based instance storage for fast I/O performance
    - Suitable for small-mid sized databases, data processing, cluster compute, sharepoint

- Compute Optimized (C)
  - More CPU than memory
