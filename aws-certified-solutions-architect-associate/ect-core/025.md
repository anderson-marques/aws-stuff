# EC2 Purchasing Options

- On-Demand (most expensive)

- Reserved Instances (buy EC2 instance capacity)

  - You do not actually buy instances, rather, you reserve long term capacity and pay for it for instance family/configuration, anytime you run (in that AZ or region) an on-demand instance that matches the reserved one, reserve pricing will apply to the on-demand instance.
  - You can purchase it at a significant discount
  - Purchased reserved instance are always available
  - When purchased with an AZ scope, capacity reservation in the AZ is guaranteed
  - Once purchased, it can NOT be refunded or cancelled
    - You can however, sell them on AWS reserved instance marketplace
      - Only the ones with AZ scope can be sold on the Marketplace
  - You are billed hourly for reserved instance, whether it is running or stopped
  - Reserved instances do not renew automatically when the reserved term expires, rather, billing reverts to on-demand billing rates
  - You have no control over which EC2 on-demand instance will have the reserved instance prices applied to
  - You have no control over which EC2 on-demand instance will have the reserved instance prices applied to
  - By default, a Reserved Instance scope is Region, however, it can be AZ or Region
    - If AZ, you get guaranteed reserved capacity in the AZ
      - You can also sell the reservations with AZ scope on AWS reserved instance marketplace
    - If the scope Region, you do not get reserved capacity guarantees
    - You can change from scope AZ to Scope Region
  - What you can change is:
    - Change AZ within the same region (keep its scope as AZ bu for different AZ)
      - This also means you can migrate reserved instances between AZs in the same region
    - Change the scope from AZ to a Region or the other way around
    - Change instance size within the same instance family
      - For instance exchange one m3.xlarge for four m3.small
    - You can modify all or a subset of your reservation
    - You need to submit a request for the desired modification, through AWS console, CLI, or API

- Spot Instances (bidding)
  - AWS Spot Instances Allow customers to use compute capacity without upfront commitments, at prices cheaper than on-demand instance pricing
  - Customers bid on Spot instances. AWS Off-peak pricing fluctuates, if the price meets the bid price, the instances are allocated for the bidding account.
  - Spot instances maybe terminated at anytime by AWS when the market prices goes higher than previous bid price by the client (who got the instances)
  - Not all Instance families are available for spot instances (T2 for example)
  - Encrypted EBS volumes are not supported in Spot instance
    - If you specify in your launch configuration, it will not be honored
    - Use it if you are flexible regarding the time you want to run your applications
    - Use if your applications can be interrupted
    - Suitable for
      - Data analysis
      - Background processing
      - Optional tasks
    - I/O optimized I Series Instances are not available as a spot instance
    - Use spot instances to augment your reserved and on-demand compute capacity, since spot instance's availability is not guaranteed
    - Always guarantee the minimum level of compute using RI and On-demand and add spot to add compute capacity and save costs
