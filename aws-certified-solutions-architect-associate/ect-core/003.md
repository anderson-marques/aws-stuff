# EC2 Instance Access

- To access an instance you need a key and key pair name
    - When you launch a new EC2 instance, you can create a public/private key pair
    - You can download the private key only once
    - The public key is saved by AWS to match it to the key pair name, and private key when you try to login to the EC2 instance
    - If you launch your instance without a key pair you wil not be able to access it (via RDP or SSH)
