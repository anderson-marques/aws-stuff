# Termination Protection

- This is a feature you can enable such that an EC2 instance is protected against accidental termination through API, Console, or CLI

- This can be enabled for Instance-store backed and EBS backed instance

- CloudWatch can **ONLY** terminate EC2 instances if they **do not** have the termination protection enabled

- If you want to terminate an instance that has termination protection turned on, you can do so by choosing OS shutdown, and configure AWS to treat OS shutdown as instance termination

- This can be configured during launch, when the instance is running or stopped (if EBS backed instance)
