# EC2 Bastion Hosts

- AWS calls it Remote Desktop Gateway for Windows (RDP)

- AWS calls it Bastion Hosts for Linux (SSH)

- For inbound, secure, connectivity to your VPC to manage and administer public and/or private EC2 instances, you can use a bastion host (or a jump box/stone).

- The Bastion Host is an EC2 instance, whose interfaces will have a security group allowing inbound SSH (for Linux EC2 instances) or RDP for windows instances

- Bastion hosts can have auto-assigned public IP addresses or Elastic IP addresses (Elastic IPs are better for security reasons and to fix the IP address)

- Using Security Groups you can further limit which IP CIDRs can access the Bastion Host

- Once logged to the Bastion host, you can connect via RDP (Windows) or SSH (Linux) to the EC2 instance(s) you desire to manage

- To configure a bastion host in high availability, you can use auto scaling groups as follows:
  - Create the Auto Scaling Group (ASG) with desired capacity of 2, choose multiple availability zones (2) using Elastic IPs on each
  - This is the recommended High Availability (HA) way for AWS

- (Not an HA but saves on cost) Create an ASG with desired capacity 1, min 1, max 1, such that if the bastion instance fails, or gets terminated, the ASG will launch another one
  - Downside is, you have only one at a time, and you may have a down time until ASG launches another one
    - But since this is for management/administration, a downtime can be acceptable

**Best Practices**: For automated, High Available Bastion Host deployment:

- The architecture supports AWS best practices for high availability and security:
  - Linux bastion hosts are deployed in two availability zones to support immediate access across the VPC
    - You can configure the number of bastion host instances at launch

- An Auto Scaling Group (ASG) ensures that, the number of bastion host instances always matches the desired capacity you specify during launch.

- Elastic IP addresses are associated with the bastion instances to make it easier to remember, and allow these IP addresses from on-premises firewall
  - If an instance is terminated and the Auto Scaling Group launches a new instance as a replacement, the existing Elastic IP addresses are re-associated with the new instances

- Do not place your private key in bastion host - use SSH agent forwarding for connecting to private EC2 instances
