# Troubleshooting - Instance Immediate Termination

- AWS recommends that after you launch an EC2 instance, you check its status to confirm that it moved from pending to running, and not a terminated state

- Possible reasons that a launched instance immediately terminates are:

  - The instance store-backed AMI you used to launch the instance is missing a required part
  - You've reached your EBS volume limit
  - An EBS snapshot is corrupt

- To find the reason of the termination:
  - From AWS Console: Go to Instances (select the instance) -> Description tab -> State Transition reason
  - From CLI use the "describe-instance" command
