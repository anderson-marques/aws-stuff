# EBS Performance

- EBS volumes measure input/output operation in IOPS:
  - IOPS are input/output operations per second
  - AWS measures IOPS in 256KB chunks (or smaller)
  - Operations that are greater than 256KB are separated into individual 256KB chunks
  - For example, a 512KB operation would count 2 IOPS
- The type of EBS volume you specify greatly influences the I/O performance (IOPS) you device will receive
- It is important as architects to understand if your application requires more (or less) I/O when selecting an EBS volume.
- Even volumes with "provisioned IOPS" may not produce the performance you expect. If this is the case, an EBS optimized instance type is required, which priorizes EBS traffic.
