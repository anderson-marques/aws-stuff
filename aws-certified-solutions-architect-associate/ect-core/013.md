# EC2 - Placement Groups

Is a **logical grouping** (Cluster) of EC2 _instances **in the same AZ**_ with the goal of providing low latency, and high throughput for _inter-instance communication_

Use SR-I (Single Root I/O Virtualization) based enhanced networking instances for placement groups

To guarantee availability, try to launch all required instane at the same time

If you try to add instances to the placement group, and you can't due to availability reasons, try to stop and start all instances, this may result in migration to other hosts that have Availability

Important: 

- It can also function on _a VPC peering_
- Placement groups **can NOT span multiple AZ**
- A placement goup name must be unique within an AWS account
- You can use different instance types within a placement group, however, this is not recommended
- You can **NOT** merge two Placement Groups
- You can **NOT** move a running instance into a placement group
- Instance inside a placement group can address each other using private or public IP address
  - Best performance is achieved when they use private IP addresses for intra-placement group communication
  - If they use public IP addresses, performance drops to 5 Gbps or less
  - Similarly, if the instances inside the placement group communicate with outside entities using public IP addresses, traffic is then limited to 5 Gbps
