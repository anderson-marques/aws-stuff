# EC2 - Placement Groups

Is a **logical grouping** (Cluster) of EC2 _instances **in the same AZ**_ with the goal of providing low latency, and high throughput for _inter-instance communication_

Use SR-I (Single Root I/O Virtualization) based enhanced networking instances for placement groups

To guarantee availability, try to launch all required instane at the same time

If you try to add instances to the placement group, and you can't due to availability reasons, try to stop and start all instances, this may result in migration to other hosts that have Availability

Important:

- It can also function on _a VPC peering_
- Placement groups **can NOT span multiple AZ**
- A placement goup name must be unique within an AWS account
- You can use different instance types within a placement group, however, this is not recommended
- You can **NOT** merge two Placement Groups
- You can **NOT** move a running instance into a placement group
- Instance inside a placement group can address each other using private or public IP address
  - Best performance is achieved when they use private IP addresses for intra-placement group communication
  - If they use public IP addresses, performance drops to 5 Gbps or less
  - Similarly, if the instances inside the placement group communicate with outside entities using public IP addresses, traffic is then limited to 5 Gbps

## Cluster Placement Groups

- A cluster placement group is within a single availability zone
- It is recommended when your applications require, and will benefit from, low network latency, high network throughput, or both, and if the majority of the network traffic is between the instances in the group.
- To provide the lowest latency and the highest packet-per-second network performance for your placement group, choose an instance type that supports enhanced networking (SR-I/OV)

## Spread Placement Groups

- A spread placement group is a group of instances that are each placed on distict underlying hardware
- Spread placement groups are recommended for applications that have a small number of critical instances that should be kept separete from each other
  - Launching instances in a spread placement group reduces the risk of simultaneous failures that might occur when instances share the same underlying hardware
  - Spread placement groups provide access to distinct hardware, and are therefore suitable for mixing instance types or launching instances over time.
- A spread placement group can span multiple Availability Zones
  - You can have a maximum of seven running instances per AZ per group

## Summary

- Cluster placement groups can not span multiple AZ
- A placement group name must be unique within an AWS account for the region
- You can use different instance types within a placement group, however, this is not recommended for Cluster Placement Groups
- You cannot merge tow Placement groups
- An instance cannot be launched in multiple placement group at the same time
- Instances inside a placement group can address each other using private or public IP addresses
  - Best performance is achieved when they use private IP addresses for intra-placement group communication
- You can (**instance must be stopped**):
  - Move an existing instance to a placement group
  - Move an instance from one placement group to another
  - Remove an instance from a placement group
