# EC2 Instance Userdata

- Instance user data:
  - Is data supplied by the user at instance launch in the form of a script to be executed during the instance boot

- **User data is limited to 16KB**

- User data can only be viewed from within the instance itself (logon to it)

- You can change user data
  - To do so, you need to stop the instance first (EBS backed)
    - Instance -> actions -> Instance-settings -> View/Change user data

- User data is not protected by encryption, do not include passwords or sensitive data in your user data (scripts)

- You are not charged for requests to read user data or metadata
