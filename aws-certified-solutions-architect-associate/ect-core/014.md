# EC2 - Status Check

- By default, AWS EC2 service performs automated status check **every one minute**
  - This is done on every running EC2 instance to identity any hardware or software issues
  - Each EC2 Status Check returns either a pass or a fail status
  - If one or more status check return a "fail", the overall EC2 instance status is changed to **"impaired"**
- Status checks are build into the AWS EC2 service
  - They cannot be configured, delete, disabled, or changed
- You can configure CloudWatch to initiate actions (Reboot or Recovery) on impaired EC2 instance (i.e. for failed status checks)
- Once EC2 instance(s) status changes to impaired because of a Host Hardware or Software problem, AWS will schedule a stop/start for the EBS backed instance to relocate them to a different host
- You can also do this manually
- AWS EC2 Service Status checks are very important for Auto Scaling Group too, to determine EC2 instance status
