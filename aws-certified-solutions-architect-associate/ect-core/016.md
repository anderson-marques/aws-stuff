# EC2 States

## Starting

- When you launch an instance, it goes through **pending** then **running** states
- Moving to running state means, the instance has started booting
- Then the instance receives a Private DNS hostmane, and posibly a public DNS hostname (depends on whether it is configured to receive a public IP)
- **If you reboot an EC2 instance, it is considered as running** and does not add additional hour for your bill
- Stopping and restarting an instance adds an hour to your billing
- When you stop an instance, AWS shuts it down
- A stopped instance maintains its Instance ID, and root volume
- **Instance-Store backed** instances can NOT be stopped, they can only be rebooted and terminated
- You are not charged for EC2 instances if they are stopped. However, attached EBS volumes incur charges
- For stopped EC2 instances, you can detach/re-attach their EBS volumes including the root volume

## Stopping

- When you stop an **EBS backed instance**, any data in any Instance-store volumes is lost
  - Despite the fact that the instance can be re-started, all instance store data will be gone
- When you stop an EBS backed instance
  - Intance performs a shutdown
  - State changes from `running` to `stopping` then `stopped`
  - When the instance is `stopping` no charge occurs
  - EBS volumes remain attached to the instance
  - Any data cached in RAM or Instance Store volumes is gone
  - It is probably, when restarted again, it will restart on a new physical host
  - Instance retains it private IPv4 and IPv6 address
  - Instance releases it public IPv4 address to AWS pool
  - Instance retains its Elastic IP address
    - You will start to be charged for un-used Elastic IP
- If your instance was registered wih an ELB, it is recommended that you de-register it from the ELB, such that the ELB will stop health checks to the instance
- If you instance was part of an Auto scaling group, the ASG would mark it when stopped, as unhealthy, terminate it, and repace it
  - If you do not want this to happen you better remove/detach the instance from the auto scaling group before stopping it

### Rebooting

- Rebooting an EC2 instance does not cause a new hour billing
- Best practice
  - Use EC2 reboot and not the Instance's operating system reboot
