# EBS Volumes Initialize

- **New** EBS volumes no longer need to be "pre-warmed".
- **New** volumes will receive their maximum performance at the moment they are created.
- Volumes created from an EBS snapshot must be **initialized**.
- Initializing occurs the first time a storage block on the volume is read - and the performance impact can be impacted up to 50%.
- You can avoid this impact in production environments by manually reading all the blocks.
