# EC2 - Block Device Mapping

- Block device mapping
  - Shows only EBS Block Store Device volumes
  - Does not show Instance Store volumes
- An AMI used to launch an instance includes the storage devices that will be included, as per the AMI block device mapping.
- You can make changes to the block device mappings while launching the instance or later when it is launched

Limits of the changes to block device mapping:

- For the AMI block device mappings, for root volume, you can only modify volume size up, volume type, and the Delete on Termination flag.
- You can NOT decrease an EBS volume size when you modify its size.
- You must specify a volume whose size is equal to or greater than the size of the snapshot specified in the block device mapping of the AMI (hence increase or keep the volume size, but not decrease it)
