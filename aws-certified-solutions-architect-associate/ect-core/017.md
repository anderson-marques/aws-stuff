# Instance Termination

- When you terminate a running instance the instance states changes as follows
  - Running -> Shutting down --> Terminated
    - During the shutting down and terminated states you do not incur charges

- By default, EBS root device volumes (created automatically when the instance is launched) are deleted automatically when the EC2 instance is terminated

- Any additional (non boot/root) volumes attached to the instance (those you attach to the instance during launch or later), by default, persist after the instance is terminated

- You can modify both behaviors by modifying the `"DeleteOnTermination"` attribute of any EBS volume during intance launch or while running

- You can view EBS root bolume `DeleteOnTermination` from "Block Device Mapping"
