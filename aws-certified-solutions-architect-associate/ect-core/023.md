# EC2 IAM Role

- For an EC2 instance to have access to other AWS services (example S3) you need to configure an IAM Role, which will have an IAM policy attached, under the EC2 instance

- Earlier on, you could only do this at the instance launch time
  - Which implied if you did not do it, and you need it later on, you had to create a new instance, and specify the role at EC2 instance launch time
  - Today (May 2017), you can change that after the instance is created and add the IAM role
    - In the Exam, see the options you are given, if old questions, you may not find de option of adding the IAM role. Go with the older answer if you are close to May 2017
    - If you fell the question is updated, and you find the option that can add it, then select it. I believe AWS will not give both options in a new question, this will be silly to do.
