# EC2 Charges

- You are charged on EC2 service in hourly based pricing
  - No partial hour charging, few minutes are considered one hour
- A reboot of an EC2 instance is considered as the instance is still running
- If the instance is stopped, you are not charged as log as it remains stopped
  - However each stop/restart is counted as one hour
    - Example: You launch an instance and within an hour you stop your instance and restart it 3 times,
      - You will be charged for these 3 stops/restarts as 3 hours in addition to the hour within which the three stops/restarts occured
- You are also charged for data transfer in/out of EC2 instances
