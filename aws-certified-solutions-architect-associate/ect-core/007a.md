# EBS Basics

- Elastic Block Store (EBS) has 99.999% availability
- You can create point-in-time snapshots of your EBS volumes
- You can resize your EBS volume size up but not down
- EBS volumes are **persistent**, meaning that they can live beyond the life of the EC2 instance they are attached to.
- EBS backed volumes are **network attached storage**, meaning they can be attached/detached to of from various EC2 instances.
- However, they can only be attached to ONE EC2 instance at a time.
- EBS volumes have the benefit of being backed up into a snapshot - which can later be restored into a new EBS volume.
