Takes advantage of SR-I/OV on supported EC2 Instance types to provide:

- Higher inter-instance PPS rates & Low latency
- EC2 enhanced networking can be enabled on EBS-backed or Instance Store-backed instances
- EC2 enhanced networking can function across Multi-AZ
- To use enhanced networking, the EC2 Instance needs to:
  - Support SR-I/OV
  - Should be created from HVM (Hardware Virtual Machine) AMI
  - Be launched in a VPC (default)
- Using Enhanced Networking does not cost extra
