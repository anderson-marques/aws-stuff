# EC2 Migration

## VM Import/Export

- Can be used to migrate VMWare, Microsoft, XEN VMs to the cloud (import) - It is like a converter

- Can be used to convert EC2 Instances to VMWare, Microsoft, XEN VMs to use on-premise (Export)

- This supports:
  - Windows and Linux VMS
  - VMSware ESX VMDK (Virtual Machine Disk) (and OVA[Open Virtualization Appliance] images for export only)
  - Citrix XEN VHD [Virtual Hard Disk]
  - Microsoft Hyper-V VHD

- VM Import/Export is supported through API or CLI, but NOT through AWS Console

- Before generating the VMDK or VHD images, make sure the VI is stopped and not in suspended or paused states

- For vmware, AWS has a VM Connector which is a plugin to vmware vCenter
  - This allow the migration of VMs to AWS S3
  - Convert it to EC2 AMI
  - And Progress can be tracked in vCenter
