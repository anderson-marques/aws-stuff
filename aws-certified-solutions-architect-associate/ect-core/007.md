# EBS Types

- General Purpose
  - SSD-Backed (Solid State Drive)
  - Are beter for transaction workloads such as small databases & boot volumes, Dev/Test environments where performance is highly dependent on IOPS
  - Volume sizes 1 TiB - 16 TiB (Tibibyte = TiB = 2^40 bytes)
- Provisioned IOPS
  - SSD-Backed
  - Use for mission critical applications
  - Provides sustainable IOPS performance & Low latency
  - Max IOPS/Volume, 20,000 IOPS
  - Volume sizes 4 TiB - 16 TiB
- Magnetic EBS (HDD)
  - For transaction workloads, where performance is not dependent on IOPS, rather on MB/SC transfer rates
  - HDD backed
  - Use for infrequently accessed data
  - Volume sizes 1GiB - 1TiB
- Throughput Optmized HDD (not SSD)
  - Ideal for streaming, big data, log processing, and data warehousing
  - Can NOT be used as boot volume
  - Use for frequently, throughtput intensive workloads
  - Sizes 500 GiB - 16 TiB
- Cold HDD
  - Ideal for less frequently accessed workloads
  - Can NOT be the boot volume
  - Size 500 GiB - 16 TiB
