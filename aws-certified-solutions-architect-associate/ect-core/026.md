# Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs)

- You can specify exatly which IP address in the subnet to be configured on your instances, or leave AWS assign one automatically from the available subnet IPs

- **Security groups apply to network interfaces** not to individual IPs on the interface, hence, IP addresses are also subject to the interface security group

- By default, network interfaces created "automatically" during EC2 instance launch by AWS console, are terminated when the instance is terminated

  - Does not include eth1 that you can add during launch (manually added)

- Network interfaces created by CLI are **NOT terminated** automatically when the EC2 instance terminates

- In both cases above, you can change the default behavior by changing the "termintion behavior"

## Default EC2 virtual network interface (eth0)

- You can create (optional) **only one** additional Ethernet Interface (eth1) when launching an EC2 instance, but you can create and attach more ENIs to the EC2 instance (the number of which depends on the Instance family/type)

- Attaching ENI when the instance is running is called "**hot attach**"

- Attaching ENI when the instance is stopped is called "**warm attach**"

- Attaching ENI when the instance is launched is called "**cold attach**"

## How multiple IP addresses work with Network Interfaces

- `Eth0` is the primare network interface
  - You can't move/detach the primary (eth0) interface from an instance

- By default, `eth0` is the only ENI created with an EC2 instance when launched

- You can add more interfaces to your EC2 instances (number of additional interfaces is determined by the instance family/type)

- An ENI is bound to an Availability Zone

- You can specify which subnet/AZ you want the additional ENI be added in

## How to add additional Network Interfaces at Instance Launch

- When launching an EC2 instance, after selectin your VPC and subnet, you will be able to "add a device", this is how you can add one more (eth1) interface
  - If you do this, AWS will no longer assign a public IPv4 address to your eth0 (primary network interface), and you will have to use an Elastic IP addresss mapped to your eth0 (manually) in order to be able to connect from the internet to your instance

## Attributes

- Each Elastic Network Interface can have up to:
  - A description
  - One Primary IPv4 addresses
  **- One or more secondary IPv4 address**
  - One Elastic IP address corresponding to each IPv4 address (via NAT)
  - One Public IPv4 address (automatically assigned)
  - One of more IPv6 addresses
  - **Up to 5 security groups**
  - A MAC address
  - A source/destination check flag

## Scondary IP addresses - Benefits

- You can configure secondary IPv4 addresses to your EC2 instances's Interfaces and ENIs
- It can be useful to assign multiple IP addresses to an EC2 instance in your VPC to do the following:
  - Hosting multiple websites on a single server (multiple SSL certificates each associated with one address)
  - Security and network appliances use in your VPC
  - Redirecting internal traffic to a standby EC2 instance in case your primary EC2 instance fails
    - This can be achieved by moving (reassigning) the secondary IPv4 address from the failed instance to the standby one

## Secondary IP address Re-Assignment

- When you configure secondary IPv4 addresses, and if you allow re-assignment, they can be reassigned to another network interface (moved, transitioned)
- You can reassign `eth0` secondary private IPv4 address to another network interface
  - For scenarios if your traffic was directed to the secondary IPv4 address, and the instance fails, move it (reassign it) to a standby instance if you have one, and the traffic will continue (The Elastic IP to secondary IPv4 association remains as the secondary is moved)
- Each private IPv4 address can be associated with a single Elastic IP address, and vice versa
- When a secondary private IPv4 address is reassigned to another interface, the secondary private IPv4 address retains its association with an Elastic IP address
- When a secondary private IPv4 address is unassigned from an interface, an associated Elastic IP address is automatically disassociated from the secondary private IPv4 address
- So, **REASSIGN IS DIFFERENT FROM UNASSIGN!!!**
- Any network interface can be assigned a secondary IPv4 address from the same subnet of the network interface or EC2 instance
- You can assign/remove IP addresses from EC2 instances while they are running or stopped

## Detaching an ENI

- **Except for `eth0`**, any interface can be detached and attached to other instances
- Primary private IPv4, secondary private IPv4, IPv6, and Elastic IP addresses they continue to be with the same network interface even when it is detached, or attached to another instance

## Remarks

- To attach a network interface in a subnet to EC2 instance in another subnet, **they both MUST be in the same AWS Region and same AZ**
- Network NIC teaming (double the capacity) is not achievable by adding ENIs to an EC2 instance
